# Working With Layouts

Layouts can be created in memory from scratch with a builder, pulled from the current window or application layout and saved to files for long term storage.

In memory layouts are created using the `WindowLayoutBuilder` class and are built using persistentIDs only, by calling similar `dock` functions to the ones provided in the `Docking` class. These persistentIDs do not need to be currently registered in the docking framework to be added to `WindowLayoutBuilder`. An error will be thrown if the persistentID already exists in the layout. When done building the layout, call `build()` to create a `WindowLayout` or `buildApplicationLayout()` to directly build an `ApplicationLayout`. If you're building a layout for multiple windows, you can manually create an `ApplicationLayout` and use `WindowLayoutBuilder` to create layouts and add them to `ApplicationLayout` with `addFrame`.

The `WindowLayout` and `ApplicationLayout` can then be saved to XML, as well as loaded, with the `WindowLayoutXML` and `ApplicationLayoutXML` classes, respectively.

The docking framework can store these layouts for you and provides special `JMenuItem`s that can restore named layouts on the application.

Layouts can be restored by using the `restoreApplicationLayout` and `restoreWindowLayout` methods of the `DockingState` class. This undocks all dockables from the window (or entire application for an ApplicationLayout) and docks the dockables specified by the layout.

Default layout management and restore is discussed in [Persistence](Persistence.md)
