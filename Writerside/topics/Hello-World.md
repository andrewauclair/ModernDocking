# Hello World

This page will demonstrate a hello world application with Modern Docking.

At the end of this page you'll know how to:
* create and register dockables
* create and register root panels
* dock programmatically (covered more in depth [here](Docking-Programatically.md))

First we will create `HelloWorld` and `MainFrame` classes. `HelloWorld` will contain our `main` method and `MainFrame` will extend `JFrame` to provide the main frame for our application.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static class MainFrame extends JFrame {
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> new MainFrame().setVisible(true));
    }
}
```

That will give us a very basic application to start working from.

Now we need to create a constructor that does the following:
* sets a size
* initializes Modern Docking
* adds a `RootDockingPanel`
* creates, registers and docks some dockables

First we set a size so that our `JFrame` shows up on screen in a reasonable way

```java
setSize(400, 300);
```

Next step is to initialize the docking framework.

```java
Docking.initialize(this);
```

This will initialize the docking framework with our `MainFrame` class as the Main Frame of the application. This also initializes internal components in the framework that are needed later.

Next, we create and add a `RootDockingPanel`. This can be further customized if you want to use a different layout or have other custom components surrounding the dockable area. For now, we're going to simple use a `BorderLayout` (the default `JFrame` layout manager) and let the root consume all the space.

```java
RootDockingPanel root = new RootDockingPanel(this);
add(root, BorderLayout.CENTER);
```

This creates a new root and adds it to the `JFrame`. `this` is passed to tell the `RootDockingPanel` what `Window` it belongs to. This is used to register the panel with the docking framework and to create any toolbars required for pinning.

Next, we will create a dockable. This will involve creating a new `JPanel` that extends the `Dockable` interface. Most of the methods in the `Dockable` interface have default implementations and are not required to be implemented.

The following methods are required to be implemented:
| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `getPersistentID` | A unique identifier for the dockable within the docking framework |
| `getTabText` | The text to display on the titlebar and on a `JTabbedPane` tab, if docked into a tab group |

We will make a simple panel that takes text as the lone constructor argument and uses it as the persistentID and tab text.

```java
static class DockingPanel extends JPanel implements Dockable {
    private final String text;

    public DockingPanel(String text) {
        this.text = text;

        Docking.registerDockable(this);
    }

    @Override
    public String getPersistentID() {
        return text;
    }

    @Override
    public String getTabText() {
        return text;
    }
}
```

Now that we've created a panel that implements `Dockable` we can start creating dockables in our constructor.

```java
DockingPanel helloWorld = new DockingPanel("Hello World");
```

This will register the dockable with the docking framework. The persistentID will be used to uniquely identify the dockable throughout the framework. In more complicated applications we would call `Docking.registerDockable` from within the constructor of our panel, as shown below.

We can now dock the dockable. First, we can do this with the panel reference directly.

```java
Docking.dock(helloWorld, this);
```

or, we can use the persistentID value:

```java
Docking.dock("Hello World", this);
```

In both cases `this` again refers to our `MainFrame`, requesting that the framework dock our panel to this frame.

Now we have a complete sample that will create a `JFrame` with a dockable with the display text of "Hello World". Full sample is shown below:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    static class DockingPanel extends JPanel implements Dockable {
        private final String text;

        public DockingPanel(String text) {
            this.text = text;
            
            Docking.registerDockable(this);
        }
        
        @Override
        public String getPersistentID() {
            return text;
        }
        
        @Override
        public String getTabText() {
            return text;
        }
    }

    public static class MainFrame extends JFrame {
        public MainFrame() {
            setSize(400, 300);

            Docking.initialize(this);

            RootDockingPanel root = new RootDockingPanel(this);
            add(root, BorderLayout.CENTER);

            DockingPanel helloWorld = new DockingPanel("Hello World");

            Docking.dock(helloWorld, this);
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> new MainFrame().setVisible(true));
    }
}
```
